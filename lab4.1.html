                                The most likely reason why Texas, New York, and California have the most sales is probably associated to their
                                population. California is #1 in population, Texas is #2, and New York is #3.

                                The peaks are in March, September, November, and December. The month with the highest sales year for year is November, and the lowest is in February.
                                Sales in general increase rapidly in the last quarter of the year. A simple explanation for this would be that people are buying gifts for the holidays,
                                with a peak in November, we can assume people are getting their early Christmas shopping done. The peak in March is more difficult to explain, except for
                                perhaps people are getting their Spring Cleaning done, and in doing so, need to buy new materials after they've thrown out old things.

                                Tables seem to be the only real high sales low profit sub-category. Low profit is generous considering it seems money is lost on selling tables. Their bulkiness
                                and added difficulty transporting may not be worth the profit gained from selling them.

                                copier machines and paper are interestingly related.

                                Same Day accounts for the lowest amount of shipping methods, First & Second classes are close together, and Standard dominates the shipping methods by a huge amount.
                                This makes it obvious that even though Same Day may be more expensive, not many people opt for it. Seeing most orders ship in Standard Class could encourage a business to make sure
                                the Standard Class' pricing is correct for how much it costs them to ship that way, as this is the most common shipping method.
