                                Selecting only movies with Chinese as the original language, we can see this pie chart's intended use.
                                Here, we see most Chinese movies in TMDB's dataset are pretty equally distributed in amount of movies they've released,
                                with the exception of Zhang Yimou, who has 3 movies in total.

                                This histogram shows all movies in the dataset and their runtimes in bins. Interestingly, you can see that the average revenue per movie increases as the runtime increases.

                                This time series shows us that newer movies tend to be more popular than old movies. It's important to remember these reviews are likely mostly all recent reviews, as this
                                website/database didn't exist back when most of these older movies were made.

                                This scatter plot shows up how 'efficient' a movie was in its Revenue/Budget ratio. A movie in the top-left of the chart means it had a very high budget and very low revenue,
                                top-right means it had both a very high budget and revenue, bottom-left means it had both very low budget and revenue, and bottom-right shows a very low budget but very high
                                revenue. This is arguable where most directors would want their movies to end up, since this is most financially efficient.
